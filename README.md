<b>1. Project Title:</b> Creating a web-based Chatbot for a Travel Agency using Amazon Lex and Django.

<b>2. Project Description:</b> 
This project incorporates a fully functioning chatbot into a web page. 
Amazon Lex V1 was used to create this chatbot whose purpose is to assist with travel agency bookings.
The chatbot is capable of automating bookings for flights, accommodation, and hire cars. 
It is then integrated into a web app using a Django framework. 

<b>3. How to use it: </b>
The code given in the project and app .py and .html files will provide the framework for your webpage.
You can use this framework and customise your own chatbot using Amazon Web Services. 
Once you have created a chatbot following the various tutorials, you simply need to update the 'Botname', 'Botalias', 'Region' and 'PoolID' fields. 
Once you have done this you should see an integrated version of your own chatbot appearing on the webpage.
